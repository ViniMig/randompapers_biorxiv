# randompapers_biorxiv

This is an adaptation of Random Papers code from McGill Space Institute. This was changed to do a similar job but using the Biorxiv repository. Original code referenced bellow and here: https://github.com/andrewcumming/randompapers
The output is a local html file with the 5 selected random papers of the week, containing: Author, date, doi, title.
Additionally for each time the code is executed a new html is created and the previous renamed with the date.
