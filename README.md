# randompapers_biorxiv_notion

This is an adaptation of Random Papers code from McGill Space Institute. This was changed to do a similar job but using the Biorxiv repository. Original code: https://github.com/andrewcumming/randompapers

The output is a Notion page with the 5 selected random papers of the week, containing: Category, Author, date, doi, title and a url to the paper. Each is set in a To-Do block so it can be checked upon reading. The to-do are inserted inside toggles containing the category, author name and date for tydiness.

Additionally for each time the code is executed a new Notion page is created and the Status tag of previous ones renamed from "New" to "Past". 

Currently setting a local windows task to execute the code every week automatically.
