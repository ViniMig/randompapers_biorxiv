# randompapers_biorxiv_notion

This is an adaptation of Random Papers code from McGill Space Institute. This was changed to do a similar job but using the Biorxiv repository. Original code referenced bellow and here: https://github.com/andrewcumming/randompapers
The output is Notion page with the 5 selected random papers of the week, containing: Category, Author, date, doi, title and a url to the paper.
Additionally for each time the code is executed a new Notion page is created and the Status tag of previous ones renamed from "New" to "Past".
